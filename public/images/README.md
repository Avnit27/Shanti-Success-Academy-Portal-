## üìù How to Add or Change an Image

1. **Find the image you want to change (see table above for the file name).**
2. **Replace the old image with your new image.**
   - Make sure your new image has the **same file name** as in the table.
   - Example: To change the first topper photo, replace `topper1.png` with your new photo and keep the name `topper1.png`.
3. **Put your new image in this folder.**
   - This is the `public/images` folder of your project.
4. **Refresh the website.**
   - Your new image will show up automatically!

## üìè Image Size & Format Tips
- **Gallery images:** Landscape, 1200x800px, JPG or PNG, under 500KB
- **Student photo (hero):** Square, 800x800px, JPG or PNG
- **Logo:** PNG with transparent background is best
- **Favicon:** 512x512px PNG
- **Toppers & Faculty:** Square, 400x400px, JPG or PNG, named as shown above

## üí° Notes
- You do **not** need to change any code if you use the same file names.
- If you want to add more images or change file names, you may need to update the code in `src/images.ts` or the relevant component.
- Keep all images in this folder for easy management.
